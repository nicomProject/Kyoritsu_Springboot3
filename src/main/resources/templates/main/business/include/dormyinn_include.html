                        The major features of the student dormitories that we run are the "handmade home cooking" and the "regularly stationed dormitory leader couple."
                        Each breakfast and dinner menu devised by a registered dietitian is handmade at respective dormitories.
                        The dormitory leader couple supports student life by taking students to hospitals during medical events or giving advice on personal matters.<br>
                        They provide compassionate support for school life.
